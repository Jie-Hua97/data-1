# Oxford COVID-19 (OxCOVID19) Data Repository 

**OxCOVID19 Database** is a large, single-centre, multimodal database consisting of information relating to COVID-19 pandemic. 

**OxCOVID19 Project** [https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/)  aims to increase our understanding of the Covid-19 pandemic and elaborate possible strategies to reduce the impact on the society through the combined power of Statistical and Mathematical Modelling, and Machine Learning techniques.

The data contained in this repository is automatically generated by our system. It represents a dump of the database in comma-separated values (CSV).
Files are grouped in three folders:

- data-epidemiology: contains epidemiological data like the number of confirmed cases or deaths.
- data-government-response: contains data collected from the [Coronavirus Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker).
- data-mobility: contains data related to mobility of population, as collected, for example, through mobile phones.
- data-statistics: contains general statistics about the countries and regions.

Each file contained in these folder is related to a different source. The list of sources is available at [this link](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/data_sources.html). The structure of each file and the meaning of each column are described in [this webpage](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/data_schema.html) for detailed explanations.
